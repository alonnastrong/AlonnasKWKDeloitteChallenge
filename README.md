If you're a judge please also review the attached screen recording, its a bit different from my OG submission on the given fourm. I was rushing and didn't show the programs ability to recognize different items, only scanning one. Oops! 

Summary: Ecoeat is an innovative iOS app that utilizes Xcode's CoreML to scan food items placed in front of the camera and provides personalized recipe recommendations based on the identified ingredients.

Key Features: 

1) Leveraging CoreML, the food scanner precisely identifies food items and recommends recipes customized to the scanned ingredients. When asked about additional ingredients not detected by the scanner but potentially available to the user, it provides insights into the sustainability of each option (added 1/27/24).
2) Each recipe comes with a sustainability rating that highlights the environmental impact of the ingredients. In the future users will be able to learn more about how the sustainability rating is calculated.
3) Don't want to use the food scanner? Swipe left or right on recipes, with a recipe search system that resembles Tinder.
4) View saved recipes from swiping or scanning!
