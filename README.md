Summary: Ecoeat is an innovative iOS app that utilizes Xcode's CoreML to scan food items placed in front of the camera and provides personalized recipe recommendations based on the identified ingredients.

Key Features: 

1) Using CoreML, the food scanner accurately identifies food items and suggests recipes tailored to the scanned ingredients.
2) Each recipe comes with a sustainability rating that highlights the environmental impact of the ingredients. In the future users will be able to learn more about how the sustainability rating is calculated.
3) Don't want to use the food scanner? Swipe left or right on recipes, with a recipe search system that resembles Tinder.
4) View saved recipes from swiping or scanning!
